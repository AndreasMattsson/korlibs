Korlibs
=======

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/korlibs/korlibs.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/korlibs/korlibs)

To make development, evolution and deployment easier, all the korlibs libraries are in this single mono-repository.

Once relevant functionality is available as standard Kotlin libraries, I will deprecate the specific korlibs libraries
and will provide a relevant migration utilities for them.
